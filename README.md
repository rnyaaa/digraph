# digraph
A neat processing digraph generator that can generate node travellers and a dijkstra algorithm

# format
The digraph has arrows, signified by the red strip on the end of each line signifying the node they are pointing to. 

The nodes are visible only if they point to somewhere, otherwise they appear as an intersection. (subject to change, might flip this behaviour)

To activate travellers, set the 'Travels' boolean at the top to true.

Same for Dijkstra, set that boolean as true to activate it.
